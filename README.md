## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains input and output data directories
- `models/`: Contains model definitions for U-Net and ViT
- `scripts/`: Contains scripts for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation
- `utils/`: Contains utility functions
- `requirements.txt`: List of required packages
- `README.md`: Project description
- `main.py`: Main script to run the project

## How to Run

1. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run the main script:
